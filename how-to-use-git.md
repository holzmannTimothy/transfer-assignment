# How to use `git`
1. Initialize a repository with `git init`
2. Stage your files with `git add [file]`
3. Whenever you made a substantial change, put it into the history with `git commit -m "[descriptive message]"`
4. See your history with `git log`
5. Move around (history and branches!) with `git checkout [[branch-name]or[commit-key]]` or `git switch [branch-name]`
6. Create new branches with `git branch [branch-name]` or `git checkout -b [branch-name]`
7. To collaborate, first `git pull` others changes, then `git push` yours
